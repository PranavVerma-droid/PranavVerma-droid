<summary>Learn More About Me 😄 </summary>

I am a Student and I am currently working on software more than hardware. I am interested and have experience in full stack development, arduino, and Server management. I hope to learn more coding and get better at the ones I already know. My ultimate aim is to leave the world better than I started with it. I want to learn ML and AI and OpenCV when I (hopefully) get time.
    
Learn more about me on my [Website](https://web.craftingrealm.tk). <br>
I also host a [Minecraft Server](https://web.craftingrealm.tk/CraftingRealm.html)!
