<summary>More About Me</summary> <br>
I am a student driven by a curiosity and fascination for technology and its possibilities. I love exploring how systems work from the inside-out, build things from the ground up, and trying to learn absolutely everything about engineering and science. And when I mean everything, I mean it. No stone unturned. When I run into a challenge, I think, break it down, experiment, and keep iterating until I find a solution. I also like entrepreneurship, especially the idea of turning ideas into solutions that solve problems. I am constantly experimenting, failing, experimenting some more, failing again, until something works and learning from it.
