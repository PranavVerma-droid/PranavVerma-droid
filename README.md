Hey there, amazing developers and tech enthusiasts! Today, I want to take a moment to share my coding journey with all of you and ask for your support as I continue to grow as a developer. So, grab a cup of coffee and join me as I talk about my passion for coding!

üåü Who am I?
I'm Pranav Verma, a developer on a mission to turn lines of code into remarkable applications. From a young age, I've been captivated by the world of technology and the endless possibilities it offers. I've spent countless hours diving deep into the realm of programming, exploring languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java, and finding joy in solving complex problems with elegant solutions.

‚ú® My Coding Odyssey:
Coding is more than just a job for me; it's a creative outlet and a way to make a positive impact in the world. Over the years, I've built a strong foundation in web development, crafting dynamic websites and web applications that delight users and deliver seamless experiences. Whether it's creating intuitive user interfaces or architecting robust backend systems, I'm constantly pushing myself to exceed expectations and embrace new challenges.

üöÄ Why I Need Your Support:
Embarking on a coding journey is an exhilarating adventure, but it comes with its fair share of challenges. That's why I'm reaching out to you, the developer community, for support. Your contributions through Buy Me a Coffee can make a real difference in my coding journey by:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Enabling continuous learning: The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and staying ahead requires investing in educational resources like online courses, books, and tutorials. Your support will empower me to deepen my knowledge and master new technologies.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Access to development tools: Building exceptional software demands access to powerful tools and software licenses. By supporting me, you'll help me acquire the necessary tools to enhance my productivity and bring my ideas to life.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Fueling my coding passion: Your encouragement and support mean the world to me. Knowing that there's a community of like-minded developers behind me motivates me to keep pushing boundaries and creating innovative solutions.

‚òïÔ∏è Let's Code Together:
By supporting my coding journey, you're not just helping me; you're investing in the future of technology. Together, we can create a world where software solutions drive positive change and shape the digital landscape. 

More Information:
I Usually Learn Little Coding Tutorials Here and There from the Youtube Channel [Fireship](https://youtube.com/@Fireship) and it also provides me with Updates Happening in the Tech World.
Generally, when I code, I just go into a project that I have in Mind, and then Google/Ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) about anywhere I get stuck (if I dont know that programming language. Example - I wanted to build an app with swift, so, I just went into the language without any prior Swift Knowledge, and, when I got stuck, I just Googled it or I asked ChatGPT.
If I Seriously Want to Learn a Full Topic, I just Learn it on [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) if that Resource is Available, for example, I wanted to start learning Vue.js (Killer Javascript Framework, I highly recommend it), I simply went to W3Schools and learnt it on there, they have great resources, for both basics and advanced (Example - Vue.js, They get you started by Importing into a basic HTML document using the unpack Vue 3, and to scale up, they teach you how to do it from scratch again using node.)


I am a Student and I am currently working on software more than hardware. I am interested and have experience in full-stack development, Arduino, and Server management. I hope to learn more coding and get better at the ones I already know. My ultimate aim is to leave the world better than I started with it. I want to learn ML and AI and OpenCV when I (hopefully) get time.
